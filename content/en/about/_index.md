## About

A graduate of Ocean University of China, I have spent my career with the National Center of Ocean Standards and Metrology, where I later earned an MBA while working. I am a Senior Engineer, a State-Class Registered Metrologist, and a lecturer for the UNESCO-IOC Global Ocean Teacher Academy.

For twenty years I have devoted myself to metrology and testing, with particular expertise in CTD calibration. More than a thousand CTD instruments have passed through my hands, leaving me with an intimate understanding of their every nuance. Equally at home in Python and artificial intelligence, I have independently crafted several data-processing suites now used daily by the Center.

While responsible for the nation’s depth-sounder metrology standard, I introduced a succession of refinements that elevated this public reference to new heights. Leading the Center’s Innovation-Fund project, “Batch-Calibration Solution for Marine (Pressure-Type) Echo Sounders,” I expanded the range of calibratable models and multiplied throughput—thereby dissolving a chronic backlog and markedly increasing the Center’s capacity to serve the public.

I have contributed to numerous National Key R&D Programmes, Ministry of Natural Resources research projects, and Center Innovation-Fund initiatives, as well as to special assignments from the former State Oceanic Administration and the former General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. My work has helped shape more than ten national metrology regulations, national standards, industry standards, and certified reference materials. As first author I hold two invention patents, two utility-model patents, four software copyrights, two metrological calibration devices, and over twenty peer-reviewed papers.
